============

circuit-calc tries to become a collection of simple scripts for
assisting in calculating electronic circuits values.

Features
--------

- *icl7665.py* calculates the best matching resistor values for
  threshold voltages.
  
Requirements
------------

The scripts are written in python and therefore require
a python environment version 3.0 or greater to be

Usage
-----

The scripts are started from command line and usually require
some parameters to be specified. To get help about a script
